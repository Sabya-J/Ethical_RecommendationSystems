# Ethical_RecommendationSystems
A recommendation system is useful as long as the users trust their suggestions. So, the algorithms must optimize their interpretability and trust. 
In recent years, the class of session-based recommendation algorithms received more attention as these algorithms base their recommendations solely 
on the observed interactions with the user in an ongoing session and do not require the existence of long-term preference profiles. 
In this research, we use a model extraction approach capable of approximating RNNs with interpretable models represented by human-understandable concepts 
and their interactions (MEME) to study session-based recommendation systems of E-commerce websites. We evaluate how MEME affects the model performance 
and devise a 'Trust Score' as a metric to quantify the trustworthiness of E-commerce recommendation algorithms, obtained as a performance evaluation of 
MEME models and its interpretability, as a step in transforming black-box algorithms to glass-box algorithms.
